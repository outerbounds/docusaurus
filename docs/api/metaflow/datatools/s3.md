## S3Object Objects

```python
class S3Object(object)
```

This object represents a path or an object in S3,
with an optional local copy.
Get or list calls return one or more of S3Objects.

#### exists

```python
 | @property
 | exists()
```

Does this key correspond to an object in S3?

#### downloaded

```python
 | @property
 | downloaded()
```

Has this object been downloaded?

#### url

```python
 | @property
 | url()
```

S3 location of the object

#### prefix

```python
 | @property
 | prefix()
```

Prefix requested that matches the object.

#### key

```python
 | @property
 | key()
```

Key corresponds to the key given to the get call that produced
this object. This may be a full S3 URL or a suffix based on what
was requested.

#### path

```python
 | @property
 | path()
```

Path to the local file corresponding to the object downloaded.
This file gets deleted automatically when a S3 scope exits.
Returns None if this S3Object has not been downloaded.

#### blob

```python
 | @property
 | blob()
```

Contents of the object as a byte string.
Returns None if this S3Object has not been downloaded.

#### text

```python
 | @property
 | text()
```

Contents of the object as a Unicode string.
Returns None if this S3Object has not been downloaded.

#### size

```python
 | @property
 | size()
```

Size of the object in bytes.
Returns None if the key does not correspond to an object in S3.

#### has\_info

```python
 | @property
 | has_info()
```

Returns true if this S3Object contains the content-type or user-metadata.
If False, this means that content_type and range_info will not return the
proper information

#### metadata

```python
 | @property
 | metadata()
```

Returns a dictionary of user-defined metadata

#### content\_type

```python
 | @property
 | content_type()
```

Returns the content-type of the S3 object; if unknown, returns None

#### range\_info

```python
 | @property
 | range_info()
```

Returns a namedtuple containing the following fields:
    - total_size: size in S3 of the object
    - request_offset: the starting offset in this S3Object
    - request_length: the length in this S3Object

#### last\_modified

```python
 | @property
 | last_modified()
```

Returns the last modified unix timestamp of the object, or None
if not fetched.

## S3 Objects

```python
class S3(object)
```

#### \_\_init\_\_

```python
 | __init__(tmproot=".", bucket=None, prefix=None, run=None, s3root=None, **kwargs)
```

Initialize a new context for S3 operations. This object is used as
a context manager for a with statement.
There are two ways to initialize this object depending whether you want
to bind paths to a Metaflow run or not.
1. With a run object:
    run: (required) Either a FlowSpec object (typically &#x27;self&#x27;) or a
         Run object corresponding to an existing Metaflow run. These
         are used to add a version suffix in the S3 path.
    bucket: (optional) S3 bucket.
    prefix: (optional) S3 prefix.
2. Without a run object:
    s3root: (optional) An S3 root URL for all operations. If this is
            not specified, all operations require a full S3 URL.
These options are supported in both the modes:
    tmproot: (optional) Root path for temporary files (default: &#x27;.&#x27;)

#### close

```python
 | close()
```

Delete all temporary files downloaded in this context.

#### list\_paths

```python
 | list_paths(keys=None)
```

List the next level of paths in S3. If multiple keys are
specified, listings are done in parallel. The returned
S3Objects have .exists == False if the url refers to a
prefix, not an existing S3 object.

**Arguments**:

- `keys` - (required) a list of suffixes for paths to list.

**Returns**:

  a list of S3Objects (not downloaded)

**Example**:

  Consider the following paths in S3:
  A/B/C
  D/E
  In this case, list_paths([&#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;D&#x27;]), returns [&#x27;A/B&#x27;, &#x27;D/E&#x27;]. The
  first S3Object has .exists == False, since it does not refer to an
  object in S3. It is just a prefix.

#### list\_recursive

```python
 | list_recursive(keys=None)
```

List objects in S3 recursively. If multiple keys are
specified, listings are done in parallel. The returned
S3Objects have always .exists == True, since they refer
to existing objects in S3.

**Arguments**:

- `keys` - (required) a list of suffixes for paths to list.

**Returns**:

  a list of S3Objects (not downloaded)

**Example**:

  Consider the following paths in S3:
  A/B/C
  D/E
  In this case, list_recursive([&#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;D&#x27;]), returns [&#x27;A/B/C&#x27;, &#x27;D/E&#x27;].

#### info

```python
 | info(key=None, return_missing=False)
```

Get information about a single object from S3

**Arguments**:

- `key` - (optional) a suffix identifying the object.
- `return_missing` - (optional, default False) if set to True, do
  not raise an exception for a missing key but
  return it as an S3Object with .exists == False.

**Returns**:

  an S3Object containing information about the object. The
  downloaded property will be false and exists will indicate whether
  or not the file exists

#### info\_many

```python
 | info_many(keys, return_missing=False)
```

Get information about many objects from S3 in parallel.

**Arguments**:

- `keys` - (required) a list of suffixes identifying the objects.
- `return_missing` - (optional, default False) if set to True, do
  not raise an exception for a missing key but
  return it as an S3Object with .exists == False.

**Returns**:

  a list of S3Objects corresponding to the objects requested. The
  downloaded property will be false and exists will indicate whether
  or not the file exists.

#### get

```python
 | get(key=None, return_missing=False, return_info=True)
```

Get a single object from S3.

**Arguments**:

- `key` - (optional) a suffix identifying the object. Can also be
  an object containing the properties `key`, `offset` and
  `length` to specify a range query. `S3GetObject` is such an object.
- `return_missing` - (optional, default False) if set to True, do
  not raise an exception for a missing key but
  return it as an S3Object with .exists == False.
- `return_info` - (optional, default True) if set to True, fetch the
  content-type and user metadata associated with the object.

**Returns**:

  an S3Object corresponding to the object requested.

#### get\_many

```python
 | get_many(keys, return_missing=False, return_info=True)
```

Get many objects from S3 in parallel.

**Arguments**:

- `keys` - (required) a list of suffixes identifying the objects. Each
  item in the list can also be an object containing the properties
  `key`, `offset` and `length to specify a range query.
  `S3GetObject` is such an object.
- `return_missing` - (optional, default False) if set to True, do
  not raise an exception for a missing key but
  return it as an S3Object with .exists == False.
- `return_info` - (optional, default True) if set to True, fetch the
  content-type and user metadata associated with the object.

**Returns**:

  a list of S3Objects corresponding to the objects requested.

#### get\_recursive

```python
 | get_recursive(keys, return_info=False)
```

**Arguments**:

- `keys` - (required) a list of suffixes for paths to download
  recursively.

**Returns**:

  a list of S3Objects corresponding to the objects requested.

#### get\_all

```python
 | get_all(return_info=False)
```

**Returns**:

  an S3 URL corresponding to the object stored.

#### put\_many

```python
 | put_many(key_objs, overwrite=True)
```

**Arguments**:

- `key_objs` - (required) an iterator of (key, value) tuples. Value must
  be a string, bytes, or a unicode object. Instead of
  (key, value) tuples, you can also pass any object that
  has the following properties &#x27;key&#x27;, &#x27;value&#x27;, &#x27;content_type&#x27;,
  &#x27;metadata&#x27; like the S3PutObject for example. &#x27;key&#x27; and
