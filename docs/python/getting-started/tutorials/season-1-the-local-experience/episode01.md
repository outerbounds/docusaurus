# Episode 1: Playlist

## Let's build you a movie playlist.

This flow loads a movie metadata CSV file and builds a playlist for your favorite movie genre. Everything in Metaflow is versioned, so you can run it multiple times and view all the historical playlists with the Metaflow client in a Notebook.

You can find the tutorial code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/tree/master/metaflow/tutorials/01-playlist)

**Showcasing:**

- Including external files with [IncludeFile](../../../metaflow/data#data-in-local-files).
- Basic Metaflow [Parameters](../../../metaflow/basics#how-to-define-parameters-for-flows).
- Running workflow [branches](../../../metaflow/basics#branch) in parallel and joining results.
- Using the Metaflow [Client API](../../../metaflow/client) in a Notebook.
