# Installing Metaflow

Metaflow is available as a Python package for MacOS and Linux. You can visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow) or get the latest version from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/):

```bash
pip install metaflow
```

:::info

We highly recommend using **Python 3** for new projects. Metaflow supports Python 2.7 for legacy applications, but Python 3 has fewer bugs and is better supported than [the deprecated Python 2.7](http://pythonclock.org)

Now you are ready to get your hands dirty with the [Tutorials](tutorials/).

## Upgrading Metaflow

If you have installed Metaflow previously, you can upgrade to the latest version with:

```bash
pip install --upgrade metaflow
```
