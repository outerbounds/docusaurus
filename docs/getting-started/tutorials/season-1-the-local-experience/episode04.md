# Episode 4: Playlist Plus

## The Final Showdown.

Now that we've improved our genre based playlist generator. We expose a _**hint**_ parameter allowing the user to suggest a better bonus movie. The bonus movie is chosen from the movie that has the most similar name to the _**hint**_.

This is achieved by importing a string edit distance package using Metaflow's conda based dependency management feature. Dependency management builds isolated and reproducible environments for individual steps.

You can find the tutorial code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/tree/master/metaflow/tutorials/04-playlist-plus)
