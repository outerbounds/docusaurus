  "description": "Traditionally, there has been a tension between local \\(e.g. on a laptop\\) and remote \\(e.g. on a cluster or a cloud\\) development and execution: Developing on a laptop is fast, whereas iterating with a remote cluster is slower. A laptop is a severely resource-constrained environment whereas a cluster can have virtually unlimited resources. Worse, simple local scripts may need to be translated to a new paradigm that is understood by a cluster.",
